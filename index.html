                <p>Apollo Milton Obote (28 December 1925 â€“ 10 October 2005)[1] was a Ugandan political leader who led Uganda to independence in 1962 from British colonial administration. Following the nation's independence, he served as Prime Minister of Uganda from 1962 to 1966 and President of Uganda from 1966 to 1971, then again from 1980 to 1985. He was overthrown by Idi Amin in 1971, but regained power in 1980 a year after Amin's 1979 overthrow.[2] His second period of rule was marred by repression and the deaths of many civilians as a result of a civil war known as the Ugandan Bush War.
